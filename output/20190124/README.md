<br />

When you look at 04_get_accuracy.png, there are three scores.  
threshold 0.5 is best score. but, false postive score is second.  
What I want you to tell something is that the best accuracy is not best.  
You should consider false postive and false negative.  
This is very important on real services or soultions.  

<br />
<br />

Many papers's evaluation use false postive, false negative, ROC curve and AUC curve.  
After you familiar with machine learning process and feature engineering, Try these evaluation.

Thanks.
